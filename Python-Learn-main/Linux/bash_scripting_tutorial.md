Hello World Bash Shell Script — Bash
Scripting Tutorial

1. First you need to find out where is your Bash interpreter located.
Enter the following into your command line:

$ which bash
/bin/bash

This command reveals that the Bash shell is stored in /bin/bash.
This will come into play momentarily.

2. The next thing you need to do is open our favorite text editor and
create a file called hello_world.sh. We will use nano for this step.

$ nano hello_world.sh

3. Copy and paste the following lines into the new file and save it:

#!/bin/bash

# declare STRING variable
STRING="Hello World"

# print variable on a screen
echo $STRING

WHAT IS SHEBANG

Every bash shell script in this tutorial starts with a shebang: #!
which is not read as a comment. First line is also a place where you
put your interpreter which is in this case: /bin/bash.

4. Navigate to the directory where your hello_wor 1d. sh bash script
is located and make the file executable:

$ chmod +x hello_world.sh

5. Now you are ready to execute your first bash script:


$ ./hello_world.sh

The output you receive should simply be:

Hello World

Creating, saving and executing a simple hello world Bash

Script.

Simple Backup bash shell script

When writing a Bash script, you are basically putting into it the same
commands that you could execute directly on the command line. A
perfect example of this is the following script:

#!/bin/bash
tar -czf myhome_directory.tar.gz /home/linuxconfig

This will create a compressed tar file of the home directory for user
linuxconfig. The tar command we use in the script could easily just
be executed directly on the command line.

So, what’s the advantage of the script? Well, it allows us to quickly call
this command without having to remember it or type it every time. We
could also easily expand the script later on to be more complex.

Variables in Bash scripts

In this example we declare simple bash variable $STRING and print it on
the screen (stdout) with echo command.


#!/bin/bash
STRING="HELLO WORLD!!!"
echo $STRING

The result when we execute the script:

$ ./hello_world.sh
HELLO WORLD!!!

Circling back to our backup script example, let’s use a variable to name
our backup file and put a time stamp in the file name by using the date
command.

#!/bin/bash
OF=myhome_directory_$(date +%Y%m%d) . tar.gz
tar -czf $0F /home/linuxconfig

The result of executing the script:

$ ./backup.sh
$ ls
myhome_directory_$(date +20220209).tar.gz

Now, when we see the file, we can quickly determine that the backup
was performed on February 9, 2022.

Global vs. Local variables

In Bash scripting, a global variable is a variable that can be used
anywhere inside the script. A local variable will only be used within the
function that it is declared in. Check out the example below where we
declare both a global variable and local variable. We’ve made some
comments in the script to make it a little easier to digest.

#!/bin/bash

# Define bash global variable

# This variable is global and can be used anywhere in
this bash script

VAR="global variable"

function bash {


# Define bash local variable

# This variable is local to bash function only
Local VAR="Llocal variable"

pono $VAR

echo $VAR

bash

# Note the bash global variable did not change
# "Local" is bash reserved word

echo $VAR

The result of executing this script:

$ ./variables.sh
global variable
local variable

global variable

Passing arguments to the bash script

When executing a Bash script, it is possible to pass arguments to it in
your command. As you can see in the example below, there are multiple
ways that a Bash script can interact with the arguments we provide.

#!/bin/bash

# use predefined variables to access passed arguments
#echo arguments to the shell

echo $1 $2 $3 ' -> echo $1 $2 $3'

# We can also store arguments from bash command line in
special array

args=( "$@" )

#echo arguments to the shell

echo Stardstol} Stargsit]} Stargsta]}y ~~ TS CS8!

#use $@ to print out all arguments at once
echo $@ ' -> echo $@'

# use $# variable to print out

# number of arguments passed to the bash script

echo Number of arguments passed: $# ' -> echo Number of
arguments passed: $#'

Let’s try executing this script and providing three arguments.


$ ./arguments.sh Bash Scripting Tutorial

The results when we execute this script:

Bash Scripting Tutorial -> echo $1 $2 $3

Bash Scripting Tutorial -> args=("$@"); echo ${args[0]}
${args[1]} ${args[2]}

Bash Scripting Tutorial -> echo $@

Number of arguments passed: 3 -> echo Number of
arguments passed: $#

Executing shell commands with bash

The best way to execute a separate shell command inside of a Bash
script is by creating a new subshell through the $(_ ) syntax. Check the
example below where we echo the result of running the uname -o
command.

#!/bin/bash

# use a subshell $() to execute shell command
echo $(uname -o)

# executing bash command without subshell
echo uname -o

Notice that in the final line of our script, we do not execute the uname
command within a subshell, therefore the text is taken literally and
output as such.

$ uname -o
GNU/LINUX

$ ./subshell.sh
GNU/LINUX

uname -o

Reading User Input

We can use the read command to read input from the user. This allows
a user to interact with a Bash script and help dictate the way it proceeds.
Here’s an example:


#!/bin/bash

echo -e "Hi, please type the word: \c "

read word

echo "The word you entered is: $word"

echo -e "Can you please enter two words? "

read wordi word2

echo "Here is your input: \"$wordi\" \"$word2\""
echo -e "How do you feel about bash scripting? "
# read command now stores a reply into the default build-
in variable $REPLY

read

echo "You said $REPLY, I'm glad to hear that! "
echo -e "What are your favorite colours ? "

# -a makes read command to read into an array
read -a colours

echo "My favorite colours are also ${colours[0]},
${colours[1]} and ${colours[2]}:-)"

Our Bash script asks multiple questions and then is able to repeat the
information back to us through variables and arrays:

$ ./read.sh

Hi, please type the word: Linuxconfig.org
The word you entered is: Linuxconfig.org
Can you please enter two words?

Debian Linux

Here is your input: "Debian" "Linux"

How do you feel about bash scripting?
good

You said good, I'm glad to hear that!
What are your favorite colours ?

blue green black

My favorite colours are also blue, green and black: -)

Bash Trap Command

The trap command can be used in Bash scripts to catch signals sent to
the script and then execute a subroutine when they occur. The script
below will detect a Ctrl + C interrupt.

#!/bin/bash

# bash trap command

trap bashtrap INT

# bash clear screen command

clear;

# bash trap function is executed when CTRL-C is pressed:
# bash prints message => Executing bash trap subrutine !
bashtrap()


echo "CTRL+C Detected !...executing bash trap !"

}
# for loop from 1/10 to 10/10
for a in ‘seq 1 10°; do
echo "$a/10 to Exit."
sleep 1;
done
echo "Exit Bash Trap Example!!!"

In the output below you can see that we try to Ctrl + C two times but
the script continues to execute.

$ ./trap.sh

1/10 “to Exit.

2/10 to Exit.

ACCTRL+C Detected !...executing bash trap !
3/10 to Exit.

4/10 to Exit.

5/10 to EXIt..

6/10 to Exit.

7/10 to Exit.

ACCTRL+C Detected !...executing bash trap !
8/10 to Exit.

9/10 to Exit.

10/10 to Exit.

Exit Bash Trap Example!!!

Bash is capable of storing values in arrays. Check the sections below for
two different examples.

Declare simple bash array
This example declares an array with four elements.

#!/bin/bash

#Declare array with 4 elements

ARRAY=( 'Debian Linux' 'Redhat Linux' Ubuntu Linux )
# get number of elements in the array
ELEMENTS=${#ARRAY [@] }

# echo each element in array

# for loop

for (( i1=0;i<$ELEMENTS;i++)); do
echo ${ARRAY[${i}]}

done


Executing the script will output the elements of our array:

$ ./arrays.sh
Debian Linux
Redhat Linux
Ubuntu
Linux

Read file into bash array

Rather than filling out all of the elements of our array in the Bash script
itself, we can program our script to read input and put it into an array.

#!/bin/bash

# Declare array

declare -a ARRAY

# Link filedescriptor 10 with stdin

exec 10<&0

# stdin replaced with a file supplied as a first argument
exec < $1

let count=0

while read LINE; do

ARRAY [$count ]=$LINE
((count++) )
done

echo Number of elements: ${#ARRAY[@]}
# echo array's content

echo ${ARRAY[@]}

# restore stdin from filedescriptor 10
# and close filedescriptor 10

exec 0<&10 10<&-

Now let’s execute the script and store four elements in the array by
using a file’s contents for input.

$ cat bash.txt

Bash if / else / fi statements

Here is a simple if statement that check to see if a directory exists or
not. Depending on the result, it will do one of two things. Please note
the spacing inside the [ and ] brackets! Without the spaces, it won’t
work!

#!/bin/bash
directory="./BashScripting"

# bash check if directory exists
if [ -d $directory ]; then
echo "Directory exists"
else
echo "Directory does not exist"
ei

The output:

$ ./bash_if_else.sh
Directory does not exist
$ mkdir BashScripting

$ ./bash_if_else.sh
Directory exists

Nested if/else

It is possible to place an if statement inside yet another if statement.
This is called nesting. Scripts can get a bit complex depending on how
many if statements deep it is.

#!/bin/bash

# Declare variable choice and assign value 4
choice=4
# Print to stdout

echo "1. Bash"

echo "2. Scripting"

echo "3. Tutorial"

echo -n "Please choose a word [1,2 or 3]? "
# Loop while the variable choice is equal 4
# bash while Loop
while [ $choice -eq 4 ]; do

# read user input
read choice


# bash nested if/else
if [ $choice -eq 1 ] ; then

echo "You have chosen word: Bash"

else
if [ $choice -eq 2 ] ; then
echo "You have chosen word: Scripting"
else
if [ $choice -eq 3 ] ; then
echo "You have chosen word:
Tutorial"
else
echo "Please make a choice
between 1-3 !"
echo "1. Bash"
echo "2. Scripting"
echo "3. Tutorial"
echo -n "Please choose a word
[1,2 or 3]? "
choice=4
fi
fi
ga
done

Output from the script:

./nested_if_else.sh

Bash Comparisons

Bash can compare two or more values, either integers or strings, to
determine if they are equal to each other, or one is greater than the
other, etc.

Arithmetic Comparisons


-It <
-gt >
-le <=
-ge >=
-eq S=
-ne !=

1. Now let’s use these operators in some examples.

#!/bin/bash

# declare integers

NUM1=2

NUM2=2

if [ $NUM1 -eq $NUM2 ]; then

echo "Both values are equal"
else

echo "Values are NOT equal"
Ta,
The result:

$ ./statement.sh
Both values are equal

2. Let’s try changing one of the numbers.

#!/bin/bash
# declare integers
NUM1=2
NUM2=1
if [ $NUM1 -eq $NUM2 ]; then
echo "Both Values are equal"
else

echo "Values are NOT equal"
fi

The result:

$ ./statement.sh
Values are NOT equal


3. Let’s add a little more complexity by including an elif statement
and determing which number is larger.

#!/bin/bash
# declare integers

NUM1=2

NUM2=1
if [ $NUM1 -eq $NUM2 ]; then

echo "Both values are equal"

elif [ $NUM1 -gt $NUM2 ]; then

7 echo "NUM1 is greater than NUM2"
else

echo "NUM2 is greater than NUMi"
fea.

The result:

$ ./statement.sh
NUM1 is greater than NUM2

String Comparisons

= equal

!= not equal

< less then

> greater then

-n sl string sl is not empty
-z $1 string sl is empty

1. Let’s try comparing two strings to see if they are equal.

#!/bin/bash
#Declare string S1
S$1="Bash"
#Declare string S2
$2="Scripting"
if [ $S1 = $S2 ]; then
echo "Both Strings are equal"
else
«i echo "Strings are NOT equal"
an

The result:


$ ./statement.sh
Strings are NOT equal

2. And again with both string matching.

#!/bin/bash
#Declare string S1

S1="Bash"
#Declare string S2
S2="Bash"

if [ $S1 = $S2 ]; then

echo "Both Strings are equal"
else
- echo "Strings are NOT equal"
i

The result:

$ ./statement.sh
Both Strings are equal

Bash File Testing

In Bash, we can test to see different characteristics about a file or
directory. See the table below for a full list.

-b filename Block special file

-c filename Special character file

-d Check for directory existence

directoryname

-e filename Check for file existence

-f filename Check for regular file existence not a directory

-G filename Check if file exists and is owned by effective group
ID.

-g filename true if file exists and is set-group-id.

-k filename Sticky bit
-L filename Symbolic link

-O filename True if file exists and is owned by the effective user
id.
-r filename Check if file is a readable

-S filename Check if file is socket


-s filename Check if file is nonzero size

-u filename Check if file set-ser-id bit is set
-w filename Check if file is writable
-x filename Check if file is executable

The following script will check to see if a file exists or not.

#!/bin/bash
file="../file"
if [ -e $file ]; then
echo "File exists"
else
echo "File does not exist"
‘Fa:

The result:

$ ./filetesting.sh
File does not exist
$ touch file
$ ./filetesting.sh
File exists

Similarly for example we can use while loop to check if file does not
exist. This script will sleep until file does exist. Note bash negator !
which negates the -e option.

#!/bin/bash

while [ ! -e myfile ]; do

# Sleep until Tile does exists/is created
sleep 1

done

Loops

There are multiple types of loops that can be used in Bash, including
for, while, and until. See some of the examples below to learn how to
use.

Bash for loop


This script will list every file or directory it finds inside the /var/
directory.

#!/bin/bash

# bash for loop

for f in $( ls /var/ ); do
echo $f

done

A for loop can also be run directly from the command line, no need for
a script:

$ for f in $( ls /var/ ); do echo $f; done

The result:

$ ./for_loop.sh
backups
cache
crash
Lib
local
Lock
Log
mail
metrics
opt

run
snap
spool
tmp

Bash while loop

This while loop will continue to loop until our variable reaches a value
of 0 or less.

#!/bin/bash
COUNT=6
# bash while Loop
while [ $COUNT -gt 0 ]; do
echo Value of count is: $COUNT


let COUNT=COUNT-1
done

The result:

$ ./while_loop.sh
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:

PNWAUOOD

Bash until loop

An until loop works similarly to while.

#!/bin/bash

COUNT=0

# bash until Loop

until [ $COUNT -gt 5 ]; do
echo Value of count is: $COUNT
let COUNT=COUNT+1

done

The result:

$ ./until_loop.sh
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:
Value of count is:

ORWNEO®

Control bash loop with input

Here is a example of while loop controlled by standard input. Until the
redirection chain from STDOUT to STDIN to the read command exists
the while loop continues.

#!/bin/bash
# This bash script will locate and replace spaces


# in the filenames
DIR=" . "
# Controlling a loop with bash read command by
redirecting STDOUT as
# a STDIN to while loop
# find will not truncate filenames containing spaces
find $DIR -type f | while read file; do
# using POSIX class [:space:] to find space in the
filename
if [[ "$file" = *[[:space:]]* ]]; then
# substitute space with "_" character and consequently
rename the file
wy "$file" “echo $file | tr ' ' '_'>
1,
# end of while loop
done

Bash Functions

This example shows how to declare a function and call back to it later in
the script.

!/bin/bash
# BASH FUNCTIONS CAN BE DECLARED IN ANY ORDER
function function_B {

echo Function B.

function function_A {
echo $1

function function_D {
echo Function D.

}
function function_c {
echo $1

}

# FUNCTION CALLS

# Pass parameter to function A
function_A "Function A."
function_B

# Pass parameter to function C
function_C "Function Cc."
function_D

The result:

$ ./functions.sh
Function A.


Function B.
Function C.
Function D.

Bash Select

The select command allows us to prompt the user to make a selection.

#!/bin/bash
PS3='Choose one word: '

# bash select

a word in "linux" "bash" "scripting" "tutorial"
e)
echo "The word you have selected is: $word"

# Break, otherwise endless loop
break

done

exit 0

The result:

$ ./select.sh

1) linux

2) bash

3} scripting

4) tutorial

Choose one word: 2

The word you have selected is: bash

Case statement conditional

The case statement makes it easy to have many different possibilities,
whereas an if statement can get lengthy very quickly if you have more
than a few possibilities to account for.

#!/bin/bash

echo "What is your preferred programming / scripting
language"

echo "1) bash"

echo "2) perl"

echo "3) phyton"

echo "4) c++"


echo "5) I do not know !"
read case;
#simple case bash structure
# note in this case $case is variable and does not have
to
# be named case this is just an example
case $case in
1) echo "You selected bash"; ;
2) echo "You selected perl";;
3) echo "You selected phyton";;
4) echo "You selected c++";;
5) exit

The result:

$ ./case.sh

What is your preferred programming / scripting language
1) bash

a) perl

3) phyton

4) c++

5) I do not know !

3

You selected phyton

Bash quotes and quotations

Quotations and quotes are important part of bash and bash scripting.
Here are some bash quotes and quotations basics.

Escaping Meta characters

Before we start with quotes and quotations we should know something
about escaping meta characters. Escaping will suppress a special
meaning of meta characters and therefore meta characters will be read
by bash literally. To do this we need to use backslash \ character.
Example:

#!/bin/bash

#Declare bash string variable
BASH_VAR="Bash Script'

# echo variable BASH_VAR
echo $BASH_VAR


#when meta character such us "$" is escaped with "\" it
will be read literally
echo \$BASH_VAR

# backslash has also special meaning and it can be
a with yet another "\"
echo "\\"

Here’s what it looks like when we execute the script:

$ ./escape_meta.sh
Bash Script
$BASH_VAR

\

Single quotes

Single quotes in bash will suppress special meaning of every meta
characters. Therefore meta characters will be read literally. It is not
possible to use another single quote within two single quotes not even if
the single quote is escaped by backslash.

#!/bin/bash

# Declare bash string variable
BASH_VAR="Bash Script"

# echo variable BASH_VAR
echo $BASH_VAR

# meta characters special meaning in bash is suppressed

when using single quotes
echo '$BASH_VAR "$BASH_VAR"'

The result:

$ ./single_quotes.sh
Bash Script
$BASH_VAR "$BASH_VAR"

Double quotes


Double quotes in bash will suppress special meaning of every meta
characters except $, \ and ~. Any other meta characters will be read
literally. It is also possible to use single quote within double quotes. If
we need to use double quotes within double quotes bash can read them
literally when escaping them with \. Example:

#!/bin/bash

#Declare bash string variable
BASH_VAR="Bash Script"

# echo variable BASH_VAR
echo $BASH_VAR

# meta characters and its special meaning in bash is
# suppressed when using double quotes except "$", "\" and

echo "It's $BASH_VAR and \"$BASH_VAR\" using backticks:
~*date™"

The result:

$ ./double_quotes.sh

Bash Script

It's Bash Script and "Bash Script" using backticks: Thu
10 Feb 2022 10:24:15 PM EST

Bash quoting with ANSI-C style

There is also another type of quoting and that is ANSI-C. In this type of
quoting characters escaped with \ will gain special meaning according
to the ANSI-C standard.

\a alert (bell) \b_ backspace

\e an escape character \f form feed

\n newline \r carriage return

\t horizontal tab \v__ vertical tab

\\ backslash \' single quote

\nnn octal value of characters (see \xnn hexadecimal value of
[http://www.asciitable.com/ characters ( see
ASCII table] ) [http://www.asciitable.com/

ASCII table] )


The syntax for ansi-c bash quoting is: $' ' . Here is an example:

#!/bin/bash

# as a example we have used \n as a new line, \x40 is hex
value for @

# and \56 is octal value for .

echo $'web: www. Linuxconfig.org\nemail:

web\x40 Linuxconfig\56org'

The result:

$ ./bash_ansi-c.sh
web: www. lLinuxconfig.org
email: web@linuxconfig.org

Arithmetic Operations

Bash can be used to perform calculations. Let’s look at a few examples
to see how it’s done.

Bash Addition Calculator Example

#!/bin/bash

let RESULT1=$1+$2

echo $1+$2=$RESULT1 ' -> # let RESULT1=$1+$2'
declare -i RESULT2

RESULT2=$1+$2

echo $1+$2=$RESULT2 ' -> # declare -i RESULT2;
RESULT2=$1+$2'

echo $1+$2=$(($1 + $2)) ' -> # $(($1 + $2))'

The result:

$ ./bash_addition_calc.sh 88 12

88+12=100 -> # Let RESULT1=$1+$2

88+12=100 -> # declare -i RESULT2; RESULT2=$1+$2
88+12=100 -> # $(($1 + $2))


Bash Arithmetics

Let’s see how to do some basic Bash aritmetics such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

#!/bin/bash

echo '### let ###'

# bash addition

Let ADDITION=3+5

echo "3 + 5 =" $ADDITION

# bash subtraction
let SUBTRACTION=7-8
echo "7 - 8 =" $SUBTRACTION

# bash multiplication
let MULTIPLICATION=5*8
echo "5 * 8 =" $MULTIPLICATION

# bash division
let DIVISION=4/2
echo "4 / 2 ="" $DIVISION

# bash modulus
Let MODULUS=9%4
echo "9 % 4 ="" $MODULUS

# bash power of two
let POWEROFTWO=2**2
echo "2 4 2 =" $POWEROFTWO

echo '### Bash Arithmetic Expansion ###'

# There are two formats for arithmetic expansion: $[
expression ]

# and $(( expression #)) its your choice which you use

echo 4 + 5 = $((4 + 5))
echo 7 -7=$[ 7-7
echo 4 x 6 = $((3 * 2)
echo 6 / 3 = $((6 / 3))
echo 8 % 7 = $((8 % 7))
echo 2 4 8 = $[ 2 ** 8 ]

echo '### Declare ###'

echo -e "Please enter two numbers \c"
# read user input

read numi num2

declare -i result

resuLt=$numi+$num2

echo "Result is:$result "


# bash convert binary number 10001
result=2#10001
echo $result

# bash convert octal number 16
resuLt=8#16
echo $result

# bash convert hex number OxE6A

resuLt=16#E6A
echo $result

The result:

$ ./arithmetic_operations.sh

Round floating point number

Here is how to use rounding in Bash calculations.

#!/bin/bash

# get floating point number
floating_point_number=3.3446

echo $f Loating_point_number

# round floating point number with bash
for bash_rounded_number in $(printf %.0f
$floating_point_number); do


echo "Rounded number with bash:" $bash_rounded_number
done

The result:

$ ./round.sh
3.3446
Rounded number with bash: 3

Bash floating point calculations

Using the be bash calculator to perform floating point calculations.

#!/bin/bash

# Simple Linux bash calculator

echo "Enter input:"

read userinput

echo "Result with 2 digits after decimal point:"

echo "scale=2; ${userinput}" | bc
echo "Result with 10 digits after decimal point:"
echo "scale=10; ${userinput}" | bec

echo "Result as rounded integer:"
echo $userinput | bc

The result:

$ ./simple_bash_calc.sh

Enter input:

10/3 .4

Result with 2 digits after decimal point:
2.94

Result with 10 digits after decimal point:
2.9411764705

Result as rounded integer:

2

Redirections

In the following examples, we will show how to redirect standard error
and standard output.

STDOUT from bash script to STDERR


#!/bin/bash

echo "Redirect this STDOUT to STDERR" 1>&2

To prove that STDOUT is redirected to STDERR we can redirect
script’s output to file:

$ ./redirecting.sh

Redirect this STDOUT to STDERR
$ ./redirecting.sh > STDOUT.txt
$ cat STDOUT.txt

$

$ ./redirecting.sh 2> STDERR.txt
$ cat STDERR.txt

Redirect this STDOUT to STDERR

STDERR from bash script to STDOUT

#!/bin/bash

cat $1 2>81

To prove that STDERR is redirected to STDOUT we can redirect
script’s output to file:

$ ./redirecting.sh /etc/shadow

cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied

$ ./redirecting.sh /etc/shadow > STDOUT.txt
$ cat STDOUT.txt

cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied

$ ./redirecting.sh /etc/shadow 2> STDERR.txt
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied

$ cat STDERR.txt

$

stdout to screen

The simple way to redirect a standard output (stdout) is to simply use
any command, because by default stdout is automatically redirected to
screen. First create a file filet:

$ touch filet
$ ls filet


Files,

As you can see from the example above execution of ls command
produces STDOUT which by default is redirected to screen.

stdout to file

To override the default behavior of STDOUT we can use > to redirect
this output to file:

$ ls filei > STDOUT
$ cat STDOUT
Filet

stderr to file

By default STDERR is displayed on the screen:

$ ls
filel STDOUT
$ ls file2

ls: cannot access file2: No such file or directory

In the following example we will redirect the standard error (stderr) to a
file and stdout to a screen as default. Please note that STDOUT is
displayed on the screen, however STDERR is redirected to a file called
STDERR:

$ ls

file1 STDOUT

$ ls file1 file2 2> STDERR

filel

$ cat STDERR

ls: cannot access file2: No such file or directory

stdout to stderr

It is also possible to redirect STDOUT and STDERR to the same file. In
the next example we will redirect STDOUT to the same descriptor as


STDERR. Both STDOUT and STDERR will be redirected to file
“STDERR STDOUT”.

$ ls

file1 STDERR STDOUT

$ ls file1 file2 2> STDERR_STDOUT 1>&2

$ cat STDERR_STDOUT

ls: cannot access file2: No such file or directory
filet

File STDERR STDOUT now contains STDOUT and STDERR.
stderr to stdout

The above example can be reversed by redirecting STDERR to the
same descriptor as SDTOUT:

$ ls

file1 STDERR STDOUT

$ ls file1 file2 > STDERR_STDOUT 2>&1

$ cat STDERR_STDOUT

ea cannot access file2: No such file or directory
ile1

stderr and stdout to file

Previous two examples redirected both STDOUT and STDERR to a
file. Another way to achieve the same effect is illustrated below:

$ ls

file1 STDERR STDOUT

$ ls file1 file2 &> STDERR_STDOUT

$ cat STDERR_STDOUT

ls: cannot access file2: No such file or directory
filet

or

ls file1 file2 >& STDERR_STDOUT

$ cat STDERR_STDOUT

ls: cannot access file2: No such file or directory
filei
